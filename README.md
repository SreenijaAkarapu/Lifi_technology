# LIFI TECHNOLOGY

## Overview
Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) is a wireless communication technology that uses **visible light** instead of radio waves to transmit data. This project explores the fundamental working principles of Li-Fi and demonstrates how information can be transmitted using light sources such as LEDs or lasers and received using light-sensitive components.

The project highlights Li-Fi as a potential alternative or complement to traditional wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, especially in environments where radio frequency communication faces limitations.

## Working Principle
Li-Fi technology works by modulating the intensity of a light source at very high speeds that are not detectable by the human eye.  
When data is applied to an LED or laser source, the light intensity varies according to the signal.  

On the receiver side, a light-sensitive component such as a **solar panel or photodiode** detects these variations in light intensity and converts them back into electrical signals. These signals can then be processed to retrieve the original data.

Because Li-Fi uses visible light, communication typically requires **line-of-sight** and is influenced by distance, ambient light conditions, and alignment between the transmitter and receiver.
